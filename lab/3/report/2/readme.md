We connected arduino uno to esp32 using I2C protocol
What we learned : 
I2C transfert only one byte each type
I2C is asyncrous (no full duplex support)


We also installed some libaries to upload code to ESP32 using arduino program
and How to create two instances for it to run simaltounsly the serial port
